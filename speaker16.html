          <p>Apurva is a 17 year old student at JPIS. If you follow this less-than-perfect world through this teenager’s eyes, you will surely dive into the unexplored, for she has a penchant for seeking the extraordinary amongst the very ordinary.

          <p>Capturing reality in its most nascent form, Niharika uniquely blends reality with her imagination on paper. Niharika has an unwavering spirit and does what she believes in. She's the kind of person who simply loves a good conversation and can go on hours talking about Drake, Dante or unicorns. If she’s neither gossiping nor engrossed in a book, you will find her in the corner of the art room where she finds the perfect solace to create bold masterpieces in order to change the ways of the world.</p>

          <p>Right from within Jayshree Periwal International School comes 16-year-old Onkar Gulati, an overly ambitious student who is fueled only by his desire to know and learn. As an avid author and a budding mathematician, he’s already penned his first novel and considers Calculus problems integral to having an enjoyable day. When he’s not staring at his laptop, you’ll likely find him at a nearby swimming pool or questioning his own existence while playing the Interstellar theme on his piano, or, in the rare case of 23rd September 2016, speaking on the stage of TEDxYouth@JPIS.</p>
