					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>One of India’s finest athletic talents – Mr. Suresh Raina has dominated the cricket pitch. His international debut came at the age of 19, and since then, he’s acquired many records and distinctions to his name. In 2011, he played an integral role
							in team India’s victorious conquest of the World Cup. Mr. Raina’s IPL achievements include having the most runs scored in the tournament, and being a two-time league champion, with the Chennai Super kings. His off-the- field endeavors include starting
							the Gracia Raina foundation, which works closely with underprivileged mothers and children, in dealing with health issues. We are in anticipation for the unlocking, unboxing, and unleashing of Mr. Raina’s ideas and stories, come December 1 st .</p>

						<h4 class="modal-title">Arjun Puri</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>Head of Admissions and Outreach for the O. P. Jindal Global University - Mr. Arjun Puri has received education from the most prestigious learning platforms like La Martiniere for Boys in Calcutta and graduated from the University of St Andrews in
							2007. Sir, then worked as a banker with Merrill Lynch International Bank for close to 5 years. There are moments in life where we are asked “what do you want to be when you grow up?” and like every child, Mr. Puri was asked the same. The moment
							he felt torn between his profession and passion, he started to do some thinking. He is an example of an idealist, where he doesn't only inspire a thousand others to walk on the path of passion but also demonstrates his career as a perfect balance
							between success and satisfaction. After moving back to India, Mr. Puri joined ITC’s rural development and farmer empowerment programme, E-Choupal. During these sudden changes what kept him going was his mantra, “I had chosen to undertake this journey
							and I will see it through.” His desire to give back to the society took his next career stop back to the education and career counseling sector. Currently, sir works as the Head of Admissions and Outreach for the O. P. Jindal Global University.
							We eagerly await Mr. Puri’s passion, commitment, and compassion to ignite a fire of curiosity and zeal in our minds.</p>

						<p>Happiness and satisfaction can only be achieved if one is balanced. Being balanced between one's profession and passion. Similarly, Ma'am is an inspiration to thousands. She doesn&#39;t only have the ability to paint a picture with her words but
							also radiates confidence and charisma which helps her balance between her corporate career and with writing and love of art. Ma’am has walked through a road of accomplishments since the very beginning as she holds a masters degree from the London
							School of Economics and Political Science, as well as masters in English Literature from St Stephen’s College, University of Delhi. She is one the best selling author of her novel ‘Daughter By Court Order’ and her second novel. It’s Not About You
							which was ranked 12th by Buzzed India. We believe Ma'am would be an ideal speaker to grace us with her presence at TedxYouth@jpis.</p>
